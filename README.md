## Installation üì¶

Download the source code:

```
git clone git@github.com:nidup/manipulate-json-data-in-php.git
cd manipulate-json-data-in-php
```

Then the installation comes into 2 flavors, directly on your host or using docker.

Once installed the commands are the same, some docker shortcuts are provided in `.docker/bin`.

### Install directly on your system (option A) üíª

Install the PHP dependencies:

```
composer install
```

### Install with docker & docker-compose (option B) üêã

Build the docker image and install the PHP dependencies:

```
docker-compose up -d
.docker/bin/composer install
```

## Use the console commands üöÄ

Use `bin/console` or `.docker/bin/console` to launch a command.

List the commands:
```
bin/console --env=prod
[...]
nidup
  nidup:json:generate-big-file  Generate 500k lines in a JSON file
  nidup:json:read-big-file      Read a big JSON file and measure time and memory
  nidup:json:read-file          Read a JSON file
  nidup:json:write-file         Write a json file

[...]
```

Launch a command:
```
bin/console nidup:json:read-file --env=prod
```

We use the prod environment here to have the most efficient execution.
